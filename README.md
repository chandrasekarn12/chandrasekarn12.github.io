# Income and Health Analysis Project
We developed a project leveraging Machine Learning and Statistical principles to discover specific relationships between income and health, providing insights to better guide funding allocation decisions. We utilized linear/polynomial/convex regression models on a feature engineered dataset and implmeneted it with NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Sklearn, and Matplotlib.
